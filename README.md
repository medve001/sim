# sim
## Python - testing life-sim ideas

### Objective: Turtle-based life simulation with plants, plant-eaters(cows) and predators(lions)

Description: Large grid, random generators, animals move, plants not, plants shown as green color of squares,
animals as circle, cows procreate after consuming x plants, same for predators, if predator did not consumed
after n turns it becomes weaker and has less chance to kill at the encounter.
Plants spread to neighboring squires as well as to random squires anywhere on the grid after reaching large 
patch size.
